# Heart Disease Prediction

Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using various machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Linear Regression, and Random Forest. The prediction is based on a dataset that contains several medical attributes related to heart health, such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more.

 Models Used
1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - Purpose: SVM is a powerful classification technique that finds the optimal hyperplane separating different classes. In this project, it’s used to classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease or not.
   - Implementation: The SVM model is trained with different kernel functions to identify the best separation between patients with and without heart disease.

2. Logistic Regression**
   - Purpose: Logistic Regression is a statistical method for binary classification. It's widely used for its simplicity and interpretability.
   - Implementation: The model calculates the probability of heart disease based on the input features and uses a threshold to classify the outcome.

3. k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**
   - Purpose: kNN is a non-parametric algorithm that classifies data based on the closest training examples in the feature space.
   - Implementation: The model determines the class of a patient by analyzing the 'k' nearest neighbors, where 'k' is a parameter that is fine-tuned during model training.

4. **Linear Regression**
   - **Purpose**: Although typically used for regression tasks, Linear Regression is applied here as a baseline model for classification after applying a threshold on the continuous output.
   - **Implementation**: The model predicts a continuous risk score for heart disease, which is then converted to a binary prediction.

5. **Random Forest**
   - **Purpose**: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes as the prediction.
   - **Implementation**: The model leverages the power of multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and handle overfitting.

## Data
The dataset used in this project includes features such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Serum cholesterol
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting electrocardiographic results
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
- Thalassemia

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and processed the data to handle missing values, normalize features, and encode categorical variables.
2. **Model Training**: Trained multiple models (SVM, Logistic Regression, kNN, Linear Regression, Random Forest) using the processed dataset.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated each model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to determine the best-performing model.
4. **Hybrid Model**: Combined the strengths of multiple models to create a more robust prediction system.
5. **Deployment**: The final model is saved and can be deployed as a web service for real-time heart disease prediction.

## Results
- Each model’s performance is documented, with Random Forest and SVM typically showing the best results in terms of accuracy and generalization.
- The combined hybrid model further improves prediction accuracy by leveraging the strengths of the individual models.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of various machine learning models to predict heart disease. The hybrid approach offers a reliable solution by combining the predictions of multiple models, ensuring a robust and accurate prediction system.
